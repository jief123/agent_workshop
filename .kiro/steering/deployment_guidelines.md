# Deployment Guidelines

When working with deployment configurations, follow these guidelines:

## Docker
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Use specific version tags for base images
- Include only necessary files in the image
- Set appropriate environment variables
- Expose only necessary ports
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use health checks

## Kubernetes
- Use namespaces to organize resources
- Set appropriate resource requests and limits
- Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration
- Implement proper liveness and readiness probes
- Use appropriate deployment strategies
- Set up proper network policies
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling

## Terraform
- Use modules to organize resources
- Use remote state with appropriate locking
- Use variables and outputs appropriately
- Follow naming conventions
- Use data sources when appropriate
- Use conditional resources when needed
- Implement proper error handling

## CI/CD
- Automate testing and deployment
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper secrets management
- Use blue/green or canary deployment strategies
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Set up proper logging

## Security
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Regularly update dependencies
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Implement network security controls
- Use secure communication protocols
