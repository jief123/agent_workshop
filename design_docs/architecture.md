# Pet Store Microservice Architecture

## Overview

The Pet Store microservice is a RESTful API that allows users to manage pets in a store inventory. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting pet records.

## Component Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with the following components:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│    API Layer    │
│  (Controllers)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Business Layer │
│   (Services)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│    Data Layer   │
│     (Models)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│    Database     │
└─────────────────┘
```

### API Layer (Controllers)

The API layer handles HTTP requests and responses. It is responsible for:
- Routing requests to the appropriate service methods
- Validating request data
- Formatting responses
- Error handling and HTTP status codes

Controllers are organized by resource type (e.g., PetController).

### Business Layer (Services)

The business layer contains the core application logic. It is responsible for:
- Implementing business rules and workflows
- Coordinating data access
- Ensuring data consistency
- Transaction management

Services are organized by domain entity (e.g., PetService).

### Data Layer (Models)

The data layer represents the application's data structures and handles data access. It is responsible for:
- Defining entity schemas
- Mapping between database records and application objects
- Providing data access methods

Models represent domain entities (e.g., Pet).

### Utilities

The application includes utility components for cross-cutting concerns:
- Database connection management
- Configuration handling
- Logging
- Error handling

## Request Flow

1. Client sends an HTTP request to the API
2. Controller receives the request and validates input
3. Controller calls the appropriate service method
4. Service implements business logic and calls data access methods
5. Model interacts with the database
6. Results flow back up through the layers
7. Controller formats the response and sends it to the client

## Dependencies

The application has the following key dependencies:
- Flask: Web framework
- SQLAlchemy: ORM for database access
- Marshmallow: Object serialization/deserialization
- SQLite: Local development database

## Scalability Considerations

The application is designed to be horizontally scalable:
- Stateless design allows multiple instances to run in parallel
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Separation of concerns allows for independent scaling of components

## Security Architecture

The application implements several security measures:
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Error handling that avoids leaking sensitive information
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error conditions

In a production environment, additional security measures would be implemented:
- Authentication and authorization
- HTTPS for encrypted communication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- API keys or OAuth for access control
