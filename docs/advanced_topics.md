   ```bash
   q "Create an automated backup solution for the Pet Store database with appropriate retention policies"
   ```

2. **Implement multi-region deployment**:
   ```bash
   q "How should I implement a multi-region deployment for the Pet Store application for disaster recovery?"
   ```

3. **Create a disaster recovery plan**:
   ```bash
   q "Create a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for the Pet Store application, including RTO and RPO targets"
   ```

4. **Test disaster recovery**:
   ```bash
   q "Design a testing strategy for the Pet Store application's disaster recovery capabilities"
   ```

## Security Best Practices

### Overview
Implement additional security best practices for your Pet Store application.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Implement network policies**:
   ```bash
   q "Create Kubernetes network policies for the Pet Store application to restrict pod-to-pod communication"
   ```

2. **Set up pod security policies**:
   ```bash
   q "Implement pod security policies for the Pet Store application to enforce security best practices"
   ```

3. **Configure secrets management**:
   ```bash
   q "How should I manage secrets for the Pet Store application using AWS Secrets Manager?"
   ```

4. **Implement security scanning**:
   ```bash
   q "Set up automated security scanning for the Pet Store application's container images and infrastructure code"
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Overview
Optimize the performance of your Pet Store application.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Implement caching**:
   ```bash
   q "How can I implement caching for the Pet Store API to improve performance?"
   ```

2. **Optimize database queries**:
   ```bash
   q "Analyze and optimize the database queries in the Pet Store application"
   ```

3. **Configure resource limits**:
   ```bash
   q "What are the optimal resource limits for the Pet Store application containers?"
   ```

4. **Implement content delivery**:
   ```bash
   q "How can I use Amazon CloudFront to improve the delivery of the Pet Store application's static assets?"
   ```

## Cost Optimization
